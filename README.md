# Lung Cancer Detection using CNN

A deep learning-based system to detect lung cancer from medical imaging data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing lung X-ray or CT scan images to classify whether lung cancer is present.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and better patient outcomes. This project leverages CNNs to build an automated lung cancer detection model from medical images, helping radiologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras for deep learning  
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib for image processing and visualization  
- Node.js (Express) for backend API  
- MongoDB / any database for user management (optional)  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend (optional)
